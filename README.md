This project is a graphical simulation of an recyling machine and recycling machine monitoring system.

Below is a screenshot of the program running below:

The left panel displays two different recycling machines where a user can recycle different items and then click checkout to receive money. Each recycling machine has a maximum amount of money and weight that it can hold. 

The right panel displays the monitor for the recycling machines. It displays the current amount of money left, each machines capacity and each time they were last emptied. Below you can add a recyclable, remove a recyclable item and change a price of a recyclable on the machines. At the bottom of the monitoring panel is a real time graph. This graph can be configured to display weight, total value, items recycled and number of times emptied for each machine within a day, week, month and year (scaled down).
